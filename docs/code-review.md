# ActiveSync Gateway — full source review

Scope: all production code under `src/` (~42k lines, 14 projects). Tests, docs and CI read for context only.
Method: nine parallel deep-read passes (one per subsystem) plus a cross-cutting structural pass.
Baseline: solution builds clean, **0 warnings**. No `async void`, no empty catches, no sync-over-async, no TODO/FIXME debt. Every analyzer suppression carries a correct justifying comment. This is a well-disciplined codebase — the findings below are mostly about asymmetry (a rule applied in one place and not its siblings), boundaries, and untrusted-input limits, not hygiene.

**258 findings.** 3 Critical, 34 High, 96 Medium, 89 Low, 36 Nit.

---

## How to use this document

Findings have stable IDs (`D1`, `K56`, `F23`…). Part 1 is a **flat work queue of 56 numbered items, each sized for one session**, in the order to run them. Part 2 is the **full finding list** by area. Unabridged detail for areas A–D is in [`code-review-detail.md`](code-review-detail.md).

### Starting a session

> Read `docs/code-review.md`. Implement **items 1–7**. Follow the working protocol in that document, including the [LIVE] live-backend rule.

That is the whole prompt. Items are self-contained and pre-sized — there is nothing to choose. Work them in numerical order unless you have a reason not to.

Naming the [LIVE] rule explicitly is worth the extra clause: its failure mode is a *silent* one (a skipped suite reports green), so it is the instruction most likely to be satisfied without being followed.

**Items are sizing units, not prompt units — batch them freely.** Ask for a range or a whole phase; get through what you can and stop cleanly at a commit boundary (protocol step 7). Over-asking is safe by design: every finished finding is already committed and struck through, so the next session resumes exactly where you stopped. A phase per prompt is a reasonable default.

Two caveats worth respecting:
- **Quality decays with context.** A session six items deep is worse at the seventh than a fresh one. Prefer 3–5 items per run over 15.
- **Give these their own run:** item 5 (needs live-server verification mid-item) and item 20 (decompositions — must start from a clean tree).

**Before any run that includes a [LIVE] item, establish a green baseline first:**

```powershell
./scripts/stalwart-up.ps1      # canonical ports; reuses a warm container
dotnet test tests/ActiveSync.Integration.Tests --filter Category=Integration
```

Expect `Passed: 124, Skipped: 0`.

This is not redundant with step 5, and the reason matters: a non-[LIVE] item runs **unit tests only**, but plenty of them touch code the integration suite exercises — item 20 splits `SyncHandler`, item 21 changes session lifetime, item 22 rewrites `SyncStateService`. Any of those can break integration, pass their own unit tests, and commit clean. The breakage then sits undetected until the next [LIVE] item, which may be many commits later.

The baseline is what catches that, and it is also what tells you whether a failure came from your change or from something already broken. Three minutes here beats bisecting ten commits later — and it runs while you do other things.

Expect `Passed: 124, Skipped: 0`. Anything else means the environment, not your change.

### Orchestrated mode — one subagent per item (recommended for a long run)

A master session works the queue by spawning a **fresh subagent per item** and verifying each result
before moving on. The master's context grows only by the coordination overhead, so quality does not
decay across a long run the way it does in one continuous session — and unlike `/loop`, which
accumulates context across iterations, this genuinely gives each item a clean slate.

> Read `docs/code-review.md`. Work **items 5 through 14** as an orchestrator.
>
> For each item in order: spawn **one subagent** told to implement that item following the working
> protocol in this document. Run them **strictly sequentially** — never two at once; they would
> collide in git and in this file.
>
> When a subagent returns, **verify independently — do not trust its report**:
> - run the integrity check from "Editing this document safely" (expect 56 / 15 / 365 / 365 / 0)
> - confirm `git log` shows one commit per finding with the ID in the subject
> - confirm the Part 1 cursor advanced, i.e. resume now returns the *next* item
> - confirm the build is still 0 warnings, and for a [LIVE] item that integration tests **ran**
>   (`Passed: 124+, Skipped: 0`) rather than skipped
>
> Then append an entry to `docs/code-review-results.md` in the established format, recording your
> verification results and anything the subagent flagged. If a check fails, **stop and report** —
> do not continue to the next item.
>
> Bring Stalwart up first (`./scripts/stalwart-up.ps1`) if any item in the range is [LIVE].

**"Verify, don't trust" is load-bearing, not boilerplate.** Item 1's subagent fixed, tested and
committed all three findings correctly, and reported success truthfully — but marked them in Part 2
only, so the cursor never advanced and the next session would have redone the item. Every check it
ran passed. The check it did not run was the one that mattered. A master that reads the summary and
moves on inherits exactly that class of failure.

**Interrupt at any point.** Whatever is committed and struck through stays done, and the same prompt resumes from there — this document is the cursor, so nothing needs to survive between sessions.

> **Do not use `/loop` for this queue.** It accumulates context across iterations rather than starting each one clean, so a long run degrades exactly the way a single over-long session does — without the visibility. Orchestrated mode above is the replacement, and it is what the results log is written for.

### Standing context for any session

- **Breaking changes are acceptable.** This is not deployed anywhere outside testing, and the published packages have no external consumers. Item 17 in particular is an intentional breaking Contracts change — take it.
- **Do not push.** Commit freely; pushing is a human decision.
- **The build baseline is 0 warnings.** Treat a new warning as a failure.

### Working protocol — follow this for every item

**1. Work findings in the order listed.** Where an item carries a sequencing constraint (item 5 / `H7`), honour it.

**2. Commit after each finding, or each tight cluster of related findings.** Put the ID in the subject:

```
fix(imap): scope EXPUNGE to the deleted UID (D1)
```

Small commits are the point — they make the work resumable and each finding independently revertible. Do not batch a whole item into one commit.

**3. Mark the finding in this document in the same commit — in PART 1, on the item's own line.** That line is the cursor: the next session resolves where to resume by finding the lowest-numbered Part 1 item with un-struck findings. A finding marked only in Part 2 leaves the cursor untouched, and the item gets done twice.

```
**1. IMAP mailbox safety** [LIVE] — ~~`D1`~~ ~~`D2`~~ ~~`D17`~~ **COMPLETE**
```

Use `~~`D1`~~ **N/A** — <one line why>` for a finding that no longer applies. Two rules:

- **Keep the backticks inside the strikethrough.** The integrity check finds findings by `` `ID` ``, so dropping them makes a finding invisible to verification.
- **No commit hash.** It cannot be written in the same commit it names — amending to add it changes the hash it just recorded. The commit subject already carries the ID, so `git log --grep='(D1)'` locates it exactly.

Annotating the Part 2 entry as well is welcome — that is the right home for anything a future reader needs (a breaking-change note, a caveat about what a test does and does not prove). It is a supplement to the Part 1 mark, never a substitute.

**4. If you moved or renamed code other findings reference, fix their `file:line` anchors.** You are the only one who will know where it went. If it invalidates a whole item, add a row to the re-verify table below.

**5. Build and test before each commit.** `dotnet build ActiveSync.slnx` is ~16s and the baseline is **0 warnings** — keep it there. Run the relevant test project. Items marked `[LIVE]` additionally require live-backend verification — see below.

**6. Write the failing test first, then fix.** Red-green, in this order:

1. Write the reproducer against the **unmodified** code and run it. Watch it fail, with the symptom the finding describes.
2. Only then apply the fix.
3. Re-run — it should pass, and the rest of the suite with it.

A test that passes both with and without the fix documents behaviour but proves nothing, and a finding struck through on the strength of it is a false record. Writing it first makes that impossible to miss: a reproducer that goes green before you have fixed anything is telling you it does not reproduce the defect.

**Do not write the fix first and verify by reverting it.** Item 2 shows both ways that fails: two `W1` reproducers were written after the fix and passed without it (unclosed nesting threw "unclosed elements remain" before ever reaching the cap), and `W4` could not be reverted at all — the fix had changed the signature, so the revert did not compile and the proof had to be simulated by neutering the bound in place. Test-first has neither problem.

When a finding genuinely cannot be reproduced — a race with no deterministic trigger, or a symptom the test backend does not exhibit — keep the test as coverage and **label it as such** in both the test comment and the Part 2 note, then strike the finding through on the strength of the *fix*, not the test. Do not leave a coverage test looking like proof. Worked examples: `D17` (Stalwart drains the pending `EXISTS`, so the stale-count symptom never bites) and `W5` (an allocation count is not observable from a round trip).

### [LIVE] Items requiring live-backend verification

Items marked [LIVE] change behaviour against a real IMAP/JMAP/DAV server. Unit tests cannot confirm these.

Bring Stalwart up on the **canonical** ports once, then test normally — no environment setup, no wrapper:

```powershell
./scripts/stalwart-up.ps1                    # Windows  (-Build to rebuild, -Down to stop)
dotnet test tests/ActiveSync.Integration.Tests --filter Category=Integration
```

```bash
scripts/stalwart-up.sh                       # Linux / devcontainer  (-b, -d)
```

`stalwart-up` reuses a warm container (it does not pass `--build`), so it costs seconds after the first run, and it verifies all four canonical ports are actually published before handing back. Leave the stack up across items — only `-Down` when you are finished with the [LIVE] items.

Reference numbers for a green tree: **124 tests, 124 passed, 0 skipped, ~2.5 min.** If your run reports far fewer, or a large Skipped count, the backend is not reachable — see below.

`scripts/test-fast` also exists and additionally covers Axigen, but it rebuilds and recreates both stacks on every invocation and requires `AS_TEST_*` overrides. It is the right tool for a pre-merge check across backends, not for iterating. **Do not alternate between the two** — they drive the same compose project on different port sets, so each switch recreates the container.

> **NOTE — a skipped suite exits 0 and looks exactly like a passing one.**
>
> Every integration test is a `[BackendFact]`, which xunit turns into a **skip** when `TestBackend`'s IMAP probe fails. A run where nothing is reachable therefore reports **green** having verified nothing — the single easiest way to strike a Critical through unverified.
>
> This is not hypothetical. If the stack is on the dedicated ports (because `test-fast` last touched it), or a shell still has `STALWART_*` exported, the canonical ports are closed and a plain `dotnet test` skips everything. `stalwart-up` exists partly to make that state impossible: it clears those variables and fails loudly if the four ports are not published.
>
> **A green run is not proof.** For a [LIVE] item, read the **passed/skipped counts**, not the exit code. Against a green tree you should see `Passed: 124, Skipped: 0`. If passed is 0, or skipped is large, fix the environment and re-run. Do **not** strike a finding through on a skipped suite.

**[LIVE] items:** 1 · 3 · 4 · 5 · 6 · 26 · 27 · 28 · 30 · 32 · 33 · 34 · 36 · 38 · 42

Everything else is verifiable with the unit suite alone, so the stacks can come down after item 6 if you want them off — items 26 onward are the next time they're needed.

**7. If you run low on context, stop at a commit boundary** and report exactly which findings are done and which are untouched. Do not start a finding you cannot finish and verify. Because of steps 2–3, stopping early costs nothing — the next session resumes from this document.

**8. Stay inside the item.** If you spot something outside it, note it at the bottom of Part 2 as a new finding rather than fixing it inline.

### Running items in parallel

Don't, by default — items are ordered partly because they overlap. Several touch the same files from different angles (`SyncHandler.cs` appears in items 6, 32 and 20; `SyncStateService.cs` in 22, 23 and 20).

If you do want two at once, these are close to file-disjoint: **2** (Protocol/WBXML) · **8–9** (WebUi) · **28** (Jmap/Dav). **Item 20** (decompositions) must run alone on a clean tree.

### NOTE — Locating a finding after code has moved

**Every `file:line` in this document is exact as of commit `ce6259c`** (the last commit touching `src/` before the review; everything after is docs-only). **Line numbers are a hint, not an address.** They drift as soon as one item lands, and two items invalidate them wholesale:

- **Item 15–17** move types between assemblies. After them, findings referencing `WireLog`, `TransientRetry`, `BackendConfigField`, `IBackendSession`, `MergedFreeBusy`, `CollectionDiff` and the `ActiveSync.Crypto` types point at the **wrong project**, not just the wrong line.
- **Item 20** splits `SyncHandler.cs` (826 lines) into six partials. Every `SyncHandler.cs:NNN` reference — items 6, 26, 32 and 35 all have them — lands in a file that no longer holds that code.

**Locate by symbol, not by line.** Each finding names the enclosing type and member, and most quote the offending expression. Grep for that first; use the line number only to disambiguate between several hits in one file.

**Before editing, confirm the defect is still there.** An earlier item may have already fixed, moved or obsoleted it:

| If you already did | Re-verify before starting |
|---|---|
| items 15–17 (assembly moves) | anything referencing Core↔Contracts↔Crypto types |
| item 20 (decompositions) | items 6, 26, 32, 35 |
| item 21 (session lease) | `A2` `A11` `A12` `A24` `D27` `D28` |
| items 22–23 (state layer) | `A1` `A3` `A4` `A9` `A10` `A18` `A19` |
| item 13 (unified redaction) | `L29` `L30` `E15` `C5` `B5` |

The baseline is pinned so git can trace where something went:

```sh
git show ce6259c:src/ActiveSync.Server/Eas/Handlers/SyncHandler.cs | sed -n '780,830p'   # what the review saw
git log -L 780,830:src/ActiveSync.Server/Eas/Handlers/SyncHandler.cs --oneline           # how it changed since
git diff ce6259c..HEAD -- src/ActiveSync.Core/Backend/                                   # everything that moved in an area
```

### Editing this document safely

You will edit this file on every item, so know the two traps — both have already corrupted it once.

**Do not use `perl -i -pe` on this file.** It double-encodes UTF-8: every `—` becomes `Ã¢Â€Â"` mojibake on any line it rewrites. Use the Edit tool (encoding-safe). `sed` is fine for byte-level surgery.

**Do not pattern-match `^\*\*(\d+)\. ` across the whole file.** The working-protocol steps above use the *identical* format to queue items, so a global match hits `**3. Mark the finding…**` as well as `**3. Contact, vCard & iTIP integrity**`. Anchor to the queue first:

```sh
sed -n '/^# PART 1/,/^# PART 2/p' docs/code-review.md
```

**Verify after any scripted edit** — run from the repo root:

```sh
# structure: expect 56 items, 15 [LIVE]
sed -n '/^# PART 1/,/^# PART 2/p' docs/code-review.md > /tmp/p1
echo "items=$(grep -cE '^\*\*[0-9]+\. ' /tmp/p1) live=$(grep -cE '^\*\*[0-9]+\..*\[LIVE\]' /tmp/p1)"

# findings: expect 365 assigned, 0 duplicates (count holds — strikethrough keeps the ID)
grep -E '^\*\*[0-9]+\. ' /tmp/p1 | grep -o '`[ABCDEFHKLSW][0-9]\+`' | tr -d '`' | sort > /tmp/v
echo "assigned=$(wc -l < /tmp/v) unique=$(sort -u /tmp/v | wc -l) dupes=$(uniq -d /tmp/v | wc -l)"

# encoding: expect 0 on both — double-encoded UTF-8, and any stray emoji
grep -c $'\xc3\xa2\xc2\x80\|\xc3\xb0\xc2\x9f' docs/code-review.md
grep -c $'\xf0\x9f\|\xe2\x9a\xa0' docs/code-review.md
```

All five numbers are invariant for the life of this document — striking a finding through does not remove it, so the counts never legitimately change. Any drift means an edit went wrong.

### Keeping this document current

Protocol steps 3 and 4 cover the mechanics. Why they matter:

**Never delete a finding — strike it through.** IDs are referenced by other items, by the re-verify table, and by any session started before the fix landed. A deleted ID turns those into dangling references; a struck-through one stays readable.

**Updating the doc is part of the work, not paperwork.** It is what makes an item resumable and what stops the next session chasing an anchor into a file that no longer holds the code.

# PART 1 — WORK QUEUE

**56 items, each sized for one session, in the order to run them.** Say *"Implement item 12"* — no sub-choices, no sizing decisions. Phase headings are context only; the numbering is a straight line.

Findings are grouped by *what breaks* and by *which files they touch*, so an item is one coherent piece of work. Every finding ID appears in exactly one item.

---

## Phase 1 — Stop the bleeding
*Data loss, corruption and process death. All Critical/High.*

**1. IMAP mailbox safety** [LIVE] — ~~`D1`~~ ~~`D2`~~ ~~`D17`~~ **COMPLETE**
> Two Criticals. `D1` a folder-wide `EXPUNGE` destroys other clients' `\Deleted` mail on every EAS delete; `D2` no UIDVALIDITY tracking anywhere, so after a restore or migration operations hit the wrong messages. Needs a real IMAP server to verify. **Best first item** — small, self-contained, highest value.

**2. WBXML decoder & encoder hardening** — ~~`W1`~~ ~~`W2`~~ ~~`W3`~~ ~~`W4`~~ ~~`W5`~~ ~~`W6`~~ ~~`W7`~~ ~~`W8`~~ **COMPLETE**
> `W1` (no depth/element cap → OOM from one request) and `W2` (unbounded recursion → uncatchable `StackOverflowException`) are ~15 lines between them and take down every user's sync. Add the hardening tests with the fix.

**3. Contact, vCard & iTIP integrity** [LIVE] — ~~`D4`~~ ~~`D6`~~ ~~`D7`~~ ~~`D22`~~ ~~`D23`~~ **COMPLETE**
> `D4` a ghosted contact Change wipes name, emails, address, photo, note. `D6`/`D7` are injection (vCard line, iCalendar CRLF). All in `ContactConverter` + `ImipMailBuilder`.

**4. Draft & MIME building** [LIVE] — ~~`D15`~~ ~~`D16`~~ **COMPLETE**
> `DraftMessageBuilder` only. Unnamed-attachment delete removes all unnamed attachments; attachments lose content type and the HTML alternative is dropped on merge.

**5. JMAP converter semantics** [LIVE] — ~~`H7`~~ **then** ~~`H4`~~ ~~`H5`~~ ~~`H6`~~ ~~`H23`~~ **COMPLETE**
> NOTE — **`H7` first, verified against the live Stalwart backend, before touching the other four.** It decides patch-vs-replace, which changes the *shape* of the other fixes. Full rationale and the safe-under-both-readings fallback are in the Area H sequencing note. Adding the round-trip suite (item 45) alongside is worth it.

**6. Delete windowing & SoftDelete** [LIVE] — ~~`F2`~~ ~~`F3`~~ ~~`A21`~~ **COMPLETE**
> Deletes bypass `WindowSize` entirely (50k `<Delete>` elements in one response), and items aging out of the filter window are hard-deleted instead of soft-deleted. `CollectionDiff` + `SyncHandler`.

**7. Unauthenticated resource limits** — ~~`K1`~~ ~~`E2`~~ ~~`K26`~~ ~~`E21`~~ `K33` `W17`
> Unauthenticated callers control Prometheus label values (`K1`/`E2`), grow the throttle table without bound with an O(n) scan per failure (`K26`), and unlock 16.x behaviour via an unvalidated version byte (`W17`).

## Phase 2 — Security

**8. WebUi session & cookies** — `C2` `C3` `C4` `C7` `C8` `C14`
> `C3` is the big one: no `OnValidatePrincipal`, so disable/block/admin-revoke don't affect live sessions for up to 12 sliding hours. `C2`/`C4` are the same `CookieSecurePolicy` change.

**9. WebUi privilege & API hardening** — `C1` `C9` `C10` `C15` `C16` `C17` `C20` `C21`
> `C1` — a non-admin portal user can repoint their backend at an arbitrary host and harvest the stored credential. Exploitable from the lowest privilege level in the system.

**10. EAS & server auth** — `F21` `F23` `F24` `F46` `E3` `E14` `E26`
> `F23` the Provision handshake is bypassable in one request. `F21` per-folder read-only grants are honoured in **1 of ~8** mutating handlers. `E3` the throttle keys on the proxy's IP, so one user's fumbles 429 everyone.

**11. Plugin & settings privilege** — `K38` `B22` `K39` `K40` `K41` `K42` `K43` `K44`
> `K38`+`B22` `Plugins:Directory` is DB-settable → admin UI to in-process arbitrary code execution. The rest is loader robustness: bypassable version guard, uncaught `GetTypes()`, host-first resolution downgrading plugin-private dependencies.

**12. Local CLI authentication** — `L22` `L23` `L24` `L25` `L26` `L27` `K54`
> `L22` with no encryption key, `/cli` silently degrades to loopback-only auth — the model the design explicitly rejects. Plus plaintext responses, no audit trail, and replayable envelopes.

**13. Unified secret redaction** — `S7` `L29` `L30` `E15` `E23` `C5` `K37` `K53` `L42` `L43`
> There are currently **four** independent redaction implementations with different ideas of what to hide. Build one, then apply it — that ordering matters, so do this before item 14.

**14. Credential & key handling** — `K56` `B4` `B5` `B18` `B19` `C6` `K9` `K14` `K45` `K46` `K47`
> `K56` `BackendCredentials` is a `record`, so `ToString()` prints the plaintext password — and it's *published plugin contract*. `B19` an empty gateway password hashes and verifies, bypassing the backend entirely.

## Phase 3 — Boundaries
*Do before the big refactors — everything downstream is easier once the plugin boundary is real. Each item lands on a clean tree.*

**15. `Backends.Common` drops its Core reference** — `S1`
> Move `WireLog.Payload`, `TransientRetry`, `BackendConfigField` → Contracts. Its *only* real Core usage is one call; the seven `using ActiveSync.Core.Backend;` directives are dead. Cheapest high-leverage change in the list.

**16. Crypto namespace realignment** — `S2` `K49`
> `ActiveSync.Crypto` ships types in `ActiveSync.Core.*` namespaces, so the slim CLI's "doesn't reference Core" property is invisible in its own source. Do it before the package has external consumers.

**17. Contracts surface** — `K57` `K58` `K59` `K61` `K62` `K64` `K67` `K69` `K71`
> NOTE — **Breaking — bundle into one major version bump.** Move host-only types out, split `IContentStore` into optional capabilities, make `CreateConnection` async, fix fail-open `SharedCollection.Parse`, add `ContractVersion`.

**18. WebUi → Core services** — `S3` `C18`
> Extract `DeviceAdminService`, `ShareAdminService`, `LogQueryService` so CLI and WebUi share one validated path. Removes the second write path to the same tables.

**19. Structural guardrails** — `S4` `S8`
> Move `MergedFreeBusy`/`CollectionDiff` to Protocol; consolidate `Backends.Common`'s three namespaces.

**20. Decompositions** — `F-decomp` `A33` `E27` `E28`
> NOTE — **Run alone.** `SyncHandler` (826 lines → 6 partials + 2 extracted types), `SyncStateService` (535, 6 responsibilities), `ProgramServer.RunServerAsync` (245), and the duplicated auth prologue. Invalidates line anchors wholesale — update them per protocol step 4.

## Phase 4 — Correctness

**21. Backend session lifetime** — `A2` `A11` `A12` `A13` `A24` `A28` `D27` `D28` `K60`
> One refactor fixes all nine: an `IAsyncDisposable` lease that refcounts use, gates concurrent access (MailKit's `ImapClient` is not thread-safe and clients pipeline), and defers disposal to the last release.

**22. State layer correctness** — `A1` `A5` `A6` `A7` `A8` `A9` `A10` `A17` `A18` `A22`
> `A1` the retry detaches the *entire* change tracker, silently dropping the tracked `FolderSyncKey++` — client acked N+1, DB holds N, guaranteed full resync. Decide the transaction policy here; it settles `A10` and `A18`.

**23. State layer performance & retention** — `A3` `A4` `A19` `A34` `A35`
> `A4` rewrites the full snapshot JSON twice per round — 2–3 MB per request on a 50k mailbox, the dominant steady-state cost.

**24. Config validation unification** — `B1` `B9` `B10` `B11` `B12` `B14` `B24` `B25` `B26` `A14`
> `B1` a CLI-settable value passes validation, persists, runs — then **blocks the next startup**. One fix collapses most of the item: make the write path run the same validator startup runs.

**25. Account resolution & storage casing** — `B2` `B3` `B6` `B8` `B13` `B15` `B16` `B17` `B21` `B23`
> `B2` case-sensitive in SQL, case-insensitive in memory → duplicate rows, nondeterministic winner across restarts. `B3` an invalid row degrades to credential pass-through **and un-disables** the account.

**26. Send/submit ordering & idempotency** [LIVE] — `F10` `F29` `F30` `F31` `D9` `H18` `L36`
> One rule everywhere: close the `try` around the submit only; record the replay marker *before* the irreversible step; everything after is best-effort and swallowed. Otherwise the client resends and recipients get duplicates.

**27. Long-poll & push reliability** [LIVE] — `E7` `E8` `F11` `F16` `F17` `F18` `H17` `H19`
> `E7` a watcher completing non-positively is dropped for the rest of the heartbeat. `E8` one faulting watcher 500s the whole Ping. `H17` the SSE stream is killed every 100s by `HttpClient.Timeout`.

**28. DAV & JMAP request correctness** [LIVE] — `H1` `H2` `H3` `H10` `H20` `H21` `H22` `H26` `H27` `H28` `H29` `H31`
> Not cosmetic despite sitting low in the original grouping: `H1` the DAV probe disables TLS validation unconditionally, `H2` percent-decoded hrefs fetch the wrong resource, `H3` `If-Match` silently dropped → lost update. Extract the shared `BackendHttpClientFactory` here.

**29. Silent failure & diagnostics** — `E9` `E10` `E11` `E16` `E24` `E34` `C11` `K2` `K3` `K4` `K5` `H12`
> `E9` is worst — its failure mode is *the loss of the diagnostic channel itself*. Adopt one policy: log the first occurrence and every Nth after, to `SelfLog` where the logger is suspect.

**30. Timezone & date handling** [LIVE] — `W15` `W16` `D5` `D12` `D24` `D33` `H30`
> `W15` `EasDateTime` shifts `DateTimeKind.Unspecified` by the machine offset — invisible in UTC CI, wrong in production. `D12` recurring events drift an hour across DST.

**31. Hosting & startup correctness** — `E1` `E12` `E13` `E17` `E19` `E20` `E22` `E25`
> `E1` request bodies are dropped on HTTP/2 (the body test assumes HTTP/1.1 framing while Kestrel negotiates h2). `E12` `KeepAliveTimeout` doesn't do what its comment claims.

## Phase 5 — Protocol conformance
*Mostly small independent fixes; each item is a quick pass.*

**32. Sync command conformance** [LIVE] — `F1` `F4` `F5` `F6` `F7` `F8` `F9` `F12` `F22`
> `F4` echoes the *rejected* sync key with Status 3, causing the resync loop. `F6` `MIMESupport` is read nowhere and Type-4 is force-downgraded, so S/MIME can't work on-device.

**33. Folder & provision conformance** [LIVE] — `F25` `F26` `F27`
> No FolderSync replay generation; every folder-op failure collapses to "system folder"; `FolderCreate` ignores the requested `Type`.

**34. Search, find, recipients & settings** [LIVE] — `F19` `F20` `F32` `F33` `F34` `F35` `F36` `F37` `F38` `F41` `F42` `F45` `F47` `F48` `A15` `A16`
> `F36` `Total` reports page size so search stops after page 1. `F47` `ReadOnly` doesn't block arming an out-of-office auto-reply. `A15` "no data" outranks "busy" in free/busy merging.

## Phase 6 — Performance

**35. Server request hot path** — `E4` `E5` `E6` `E18` `E31` `E35` `F13` `F14` `F15` `F28` `F40` `F43`
> `E4` every request constructs all 20 handlers and discards 19. Biggest single allocation win for a polling fleet.

**36. Backend round trips** [LIVE] — `D3` `D14` `D19` `D32` `H13` `H14` `H15` `H24` `H25`
> `D3` every mail fetch pulls the full message and decodes every attachment just to read its length — while holding the per-user IMAP gate.

**37. Core & CLI startup** — `B7` `B28` `L35` `L41`
> `L35` every CLI command builds a parallel DI container and EF model beside the warm one. Fixing it is also what makes the CLI stop feeling like a foreign body in Server.

**38. Incremental sync** [LIVE] — `H8` `H9` `H11` `H16`
> NOTE — **Design item, few edits.** Neither backend uses `/changes` or `sync-collection`; every sync is a full enumeration. Decide and write it down — it's the root of items 36's cost.

## Phase 7 — Tests
*One suite per item. Each converts a class of bug from "found by review" to "found by CI".*

**39. Endpoint authorization tests** — `C19`
> Enumerate `EndpointDataSource`; assert every `/admin/api` route carries `AdminPolicy`, every `/user/api` carries `UserPolicy`, and the anonymous set is exactly the known four. Also assert no CORS — the CSRF design silently depends on it.

**40. AuthThrottle & metrics tests** — `K31`
> The two files with mutable shared state and locks have no tests at all. Inject `TimeProvider` (`K32`) as part of this.

**41. WBXML hardening & code-page tests** — `W12` `W13` `W14`
> Depth/width/fuzz cases, plus a table-validation test — a duplicate tag name currently fails as `TypeInitializationException` on the *first WBXML request the gateway ever serves*.

**42. JSCalendar/JSContact round-trip suite** [LIVE]
> Property-based EAS → JSCalendar/JSContact → EAS over recurrence, all-day, floating times, cleared fields. Would have caught `H4` `H5` `H6` `H23` mechanically.

**43. CLI error-path tests** — `L33`
> Blocked until errors route through the injected console instead of raw `Console.Error` — do that here; it also removes most of `L25`'s process-global redirection.

**44. Architecture & migration guardrails** — `S5` `S6`
> Assert `IGatewayPlugin`'s assembly references only Protocol + Microsoft.Extensions + framework. Assert the Sqlite/Npgsql migration sets agree on their ordered name lists.

**45. Per-backend test project**
> Core.Tests currently hosts the backend tests. Split them out.

## Phase 8 — Cleanup
*By area. Safe to reorder or skip; nothing else depends on these.*

**46. Core state & backend nits** — `A20` `A23` `A25` `A26` `A27` `A29` `A30` `A31` `A32` `S9`
> `S9` — ten-plus copies of the same three-line `VSTHRD103` pragma and comment (`SyncStateService` alone has five). Hoist to one file-level suppression, or an `.editorconfig` entry carrying the rationale once.
**47. Core accounts & settings nits** — `B20` `B27` `B29` `B30` `B31` `B32`
**48. WebUi nits** — `C12` `C13`
**49. Backend behaviour nits** — `D8` `D10` `D11` `D13` `D18` `D20` `D21` `D25` `D26` `D29` `D30` `D31` `D34` `D35` `D-nits`
**50. Server pipeline nits** — `E29` `E30` `E32` `E33`
**51. EAS handler nits** — `F39` `F44`
**52. TLS & certificate handling** — `K6` `K7` `K8` `K10` `K11` `K13` `K15` `K16` `K17` `K18`
> `K6` a 20-year self-signed cert violates Apple's 825-day limit — iOS is the flagship client, so a user who explicitly trusts it can still be refused.

**53. Crypto & throttle correctness** — `K19` `K20` `K21` `K22` `K23` `K24` `K25` `K27` `K28` `K29` `K30` `K32` `K51` `K52` `K55`
> `K19` ambiguous AAD delimiter, `K22` unbounded PBKDF2 iteration count from stored data.

**54. Contracts & shared-helper nits** — `K12` `K34` `K35` `K36` `K48` `K50` `K63` `K65` `K66` `K68` `K70`
**55. CLI nits** — `L28` `L31` `L32` `L34` `L37` `L38` `L39` `L40` `L44` `L45` `L46` `L47` `L48`
> `L28` a `[` in a certificate subject crashes `eas tls`. `L31` mixed-case logins report "not blocked" when they are. `L32` `purge user` leaves shared-calendar grants behind.

**56. Protocol & WBXML nits** — `W9` `W10` `W11` `W18` `W19` `W20` `W21`

# PART 2 — FULL FINDING LIST

*(Areas A–D are recorded in full detail in [`code-review-detail.md`](code-review-detail.md); summarized here for completeness. Areas E–W are given in full below.)*

## Area A — Core: State / Sync / Backend (35)
`A1` **High** Folder-registry retry detaches the entire change tracker, dropping the tracked `Device.FolderSyncKey++` while the client is acked with the incremented value — `State/SyncStateService.cs:176`. Detach only `Entries<UserFolder>()`, or use a dedicated context.
`A2` **High** Idle eviction disposes sessions an active Ping is using (`SessionIdleMinutes` 15 vs `MaxHeartbeatSeconds` 1770) — `Backend/BackendSessionFactory.cs:246`.
`A3` **High** Per-item DAV id mapping is a hard N+1: one SELECT + one full `SaveChanges` per item — `State/SyncStateService.cs:417`.
`A4` **High** Snapshot JSON fully rewritten twice per round; 2–3 MB/request on a 50k mailbox — `State/SyncStateService.cs:382`.
`A5` **Med** `SaveChangesAsync(bool, ct)` not overridden, so concurrency stamping can be bypassed — `State/SyncDbContext.cs:104`.
`A6` **Med** `Device.FolderSyncKey` bumped with no concurrency token; pipelined FolderSyncs lose updates and 500 — `State/SyncStateService.cs:243`.
`A7` **Med** Whole folder hierarchy deleted+reinserted on every commit — `State/SyncStateService.cs:246`.
`A8` **Med** Folder diff never compares `Type`, so a folder changing class never issues an Update — `State/SyncStateService.cs:228`.
`A9` **Med** Over-broad `DbUpdateException` catches mask real failures and rethrow a confusing secondary — `State/SyncStateService.cs:97,433,174`.
`A10` **Med** Every mutating helper flushes the whole request; no transaction spans a multi-collection Sync — `State/SyncStateService.cs:299…532`.
`A11` **Med** `GetSessionAsync` queries share grants per request for a value only used on session creation — `Backend/BackendSessionFactory.cs:157`.
`A12` **Med** `CompositeBackendSession.DisposeAsync` leaks remaining connections if one throws — silently — `Backend/CompositeBackendSession.cs:82`.
`A13` **Med** `EvictIdleSessions` is an unguarded timer callback — an escaping exception **terminates the process** — `Backend/BackendSessionFactory.cs:246`.
`A14` **Med** `ValidateFields` matches scalars case-sensitively, lists case-insensitively — `Backend/BackendConfigValidation.cs:40`.
`A15` **Med** `MergedFreeBusy`: "no data" (`'4'`) outranks "busy" — a busy slot is reported as unknown — `Backend/MergedFreeBusy.cs:31`.
`A16`–`A35` Low/Nit: inverted free/busy window and unvalidated `Kind` (`A16`); detached `CollectionState` on Invalid (`A17`); entity left dirty after concurrency failure (`A18`); tracking on read-only queries (`A19`); two unreachable branches in `CollectionDiff` (`A20`); deletes bypass the window (`A21`); wipe-ack check-then-act race (`A22`); double provider resolve (`A23`); unsynchronized `LastUsedUtc` (`A24`); publicly mutable `TransientRetry.DelaysMs` (`A25`); retry ignores cancellation (`A26`); unsalted cached password hashes, non-constant-time compare (`A27`); handlers never unsubscribed (`A28`); misleading `created` log (`A29`); `ListRoot` contradicts its doc (`A30`); `Add`/`AddAsync` inconsistency (`A31`); `ct` not last (`A32`); `SyncStateService` unsealed, 6 responsibilities (`A33`); duplicated snapshot deserialization (`A34`); soft-deleted folders never reclaimed (`A35`).

## Area B — Core: Accounts / Administration / Settings / Options (32)
`B1` **High** A CLI-settable value passes catalogue validation then blocks the next startup (delayed brick) — `Administration/SettingKeys.cs:67` vs `Options/ActiveSyncOptionsValidator.cs:25`.
`B2` **High** Case-sensitive in SQL, case-insensitive in memory → duplicate rows, nondeterministic winner — `Accounts/AccountStore.cs:65,89,113`, `Settings/GlobalSettingStore.cs:41,57,80`.
`B3` **High** An invalid DB account row degrades to credential pass-through **and un-disables** the account — `Accounts/AccountResolver.cs:271`.
`B4` **High** `TryLoadKey` error discarded → misconfigured key stores backend passwords in plaintext — `Administration/AccountSecretPolicy.cs:53`.
`B5` **High** `eas config set` stores catalogue secrets in plaintext; the web UI seals them — `Administration/SettingKeys.cs:136,149`.
`B6` **High** Failed snapshot rebuild leaves stale auth config, never retries, and logs the wrong subsystem — `Accounts/AccountResolver.cs:142`, `Settings/SettingsRefresher.cs:58`.
`B7` **High** Every account edit re-validates every account on a request thread with file I/O; auto-provisioning is O(N²) — `Accounts/AccountResolver.cs:239`.
`B8` **High** `AccountEditing` uses the wrong comparer for config users, silently wiping their overrides — `Administration/AccountEditing.cs:27`.
`B9`–`B22` **Med**: DB outage hidden behind Debug, silently downgrading restart-tier settings (`B9`); `Number` settings ignore Min/Max and accept NaN/Infinity (`B10`); negative `UsersRefreshSeconds` permanently disables its own repair (`B11`); bootstrap keys unenforced in the store and provider (`B12`); legacy JSON conversion drops `Admin`/`Enabled`/`AutoProvisioned` (`B13`); live role rebuild never runs provider validation, and kept snapshots read through live anyway (`B14`); `GetAsync`/`ListAsync` throw on a row `LoadAllAsync` tolerates — breaking the tools you'd use to fix it (`B15`); null settings delete inherited globals but the doc says ignored (`B16`); untrimmed `Provider` silently disables inheritance (`B17`); a sealed gateway password never authenticates and is never reported (`B18`); empty gateway password hashes and verifies — bypassing the backend entirely (`B19`); unsanitized login text reflected into logs enables log forging (`B20`); config users on an unconfigured gateway throw at startup (`B21`); `Plugins:Directory`/`UsersFile` DB-settable → code load + arbitrary file read (`B22`).
`B23`–`B32` Low/Nit: unsynchronized `_lastDbUsers` (`B23`); `Provider` switch leaves stale settings unchecked (`B24`); secret detection is a `"Password"` suffix match (`B25`); several bounds absent from the options validator (`B26`); IPv6 host brackets break Npgsql (`B27`); `OrderedRoles` sorts per read (`B28`); help string inside a key collection (`B29`); empty settings key accepted (`B30`); generic helper hardcodes "BaseUrl" (`B31`); unreachable duplicate-role check (`B32`).

## Area C — WebUi (21)
Baseline verified good: no endpoint is unauthenticated by accident (route-group `RequireAuthorization`, exactly four deliberate `AllowAnonymous`), **zero** XSS sinks in ~2000 lines of hand-rolled frontend, TLS private keys structurally excluded, login timing-indistinguishable, destructive ops require typed confirmation, OIDC principal re-minted so IdP claims never enter the session.
`C1` **High** Portal users can rewrite their own backend connection settings → SSRF + backend credential exfiltration — `Api/PortalEndpoints.cs:208`.
`C2` **High** Session cookie uses `CookieSecurePolicy.SameAsRequest` → no `Secure` flag behind a proxy that doesn't forward proto — `Setup/WebUiServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:43`.
`C3` **High** No `OnValidatePrincipal`: disable/block/admin-revoke don't affect live sessions for up to 12 sliding hours — `Setup/WebUiServiceCollectionExtensions.cs:44`.
`C4`–`C11` **Med**: OIDC correlation/nonce cookies keep `SameSite=None` without guaranteed `Secure` (`C4`); per-account backend `Settings` returned verbatim, unlike the global section (`C5`); portal password change bypasses the shared policy, no strength floor (`C6`); OIDC trusts mutable `preferred_username` → takeover at some IdPs (`C7`); `AdminClaim` without `AdminClaimValue` grants admin to the whole directory (`C8`); backend probe returns raw exception text → internal network scanner (`C9`); devices/shares endpoints unbounded (`C10`); `DbXmlRepository` discards unreadable keys with zero operator signal (`C11`).
`C12`–`C21` Low/Nit: no DataProtection revocation path (`C12`); `backends/meta` reads a stale snapshot (`C13`); logout is client-side only (`C14`); unescaped `LIKE` + unindexed full scan per keystroke (`C15`); unvalidated block/share identifiers (`C16`); admin can remove the last admin (`C17`); WebUi reaches into `SyncDbContext` directly in 4 files (`C18`); no endpoint-authorization tests (`C19`); CSP omits `base-uri`/`form-action`/`object-src` (`C20`); duplicated role parsing and ad-hoc error shapes (`C21`).
**Note:** the CSRF design (`X-EAS-WebUi` + `SameSite=Strict`) is sound *specifically because* there is no `AddCors` anywhere in `src/`. Adding CORS for any reason silently removes the primary CSRF defense — worth a comment on the filter and an assertion in the test suite.

## Area D — Backends: Common / Imap / Smtp / Local / Sieve (35 + nits)
~~`D1`~~ **FIXED** **CRITICAL** `ExpungeAsync()` with no UID set destroys other clients' `\Deleted` messages — `Imap/ImapMailBackend.cs:204,312`.
~~`D2`~~ **FIXED** **CRITICAL** No UIDVALIDITY tracking anywhere in the repo → stale keys address the wrong messages after a restore/migration — `Imap/ImapSession.cs`, `ImapMailBackend.cs:581`. Mail item keys are now `<uidvalidity>:<uid>` (`ToItemKey`/`ParseUid`), and UIDVALIDITY leads the `SnapshotStatusAsync` fingerprint. **Breaking:** one full re-sync of IMAP mail folders on upgrade, as pre-existing bare-UID keys are reissued.
`D3` **High** Every mail fetch downloads the full message; `EstimateSize` decodes every attachment to a MemoryStream just to read `.Length`, while holding the session gate — `Imap/ImapMailBackend.cs:136`, `Common/Converters/MailConverter.cs:290`.
~~`D4`~~ **FIXED** Contact update wiped every managed vCard property absent from the payload — `Common/Converters/ContactConverter.cs`. `FromApplicationData` now overlays the payload on the stored card's own EAS view (`Ghost`, built from the same `ToApplicationData` read mapping so the two can't drift) before building. **Presence, not value, decides:** an element sent empty still clears the property, so "clear this field" stays expressible. The photo cap moved to a parameter — the wire view still drops photos ≥ 96 KiB, the merge view keeps them, so an oversized stored photo survives an update it was never sent in. Note: this changes contact Change semantics from full-replace to ghosted; `Update_PresentElementsWin_OverTheStoredValue` (was `Update_ManagedFieldsComeFromThePayload_NotTheOldCard`) was rewritten accordingly.
`D5` **High** Meeting-request times ignore `TZID` and are treated as UTC; no line unfolding — `Common/Converters/MailConverter.cs:211,277`.
~~`D6`~~ **FIXED** vCard line injection via the contact `Picture` element — `Common/Converters/ContactConverter.cs` (`AppendPhoto`). The base64 is now decoded and **re-encoded** rather than interpolated, so an embedded CRLF cannot survive into the card regardless of what `Convert.TryFromBase64String` tolerates in its input; undecodable values are skipped, and `TYPE=` is derived from the decoded magic bytes (JPEG/PNG/GIF) or omitted rather than asserted as JPEG.
~~`D7`~~ **FIXED** iCalendar CRLF injection + platform line endings in generated CANCEL messages — `Common/Converters/ImipMailBuilder.cs`. `BuildCancel` now goes through `Ical.Net` exactly as `BuildRequest` does, so the serializer escapes and folds every value and emits CRLF. Note the property is **structural, not textual**: a crafted UID still appears in the output, escaped as a literal `\n` inside the UID value — what the test asserts is that it never becomes a line of its own (exactly one `ATTENDEE:`, one `METHOD:`, no `X-INJECTED:`). Uses `RecurrenceIdentifier`, not the obsolete `RecurrenceId`. The CRLF test is **coverage, not a reproducer** — `Environment.NewLine` is already CRLF on Windows, so it only bites on the Linux containers.
~~`D15`~~ **FIXED** Unnamed-attachment delete removed every unnamed attachment — `Common/Converters/DraftMessageBuilder.cs` (`CollectAttachments`). Deletes now match the **index** parsed out of the FileReference (`DelimitedKey(folderKey, itemKey, index)`, the shape both mail backends mint and the one `GetAttachmentAsync` resolves with `Attachments.Skip(index)`) instead of testing whether the reference ends with the attachment's file name — a test an empty name passed for *every* reference. A reference we did not mint parses to `-1` and targets nothing, preserving the old "missing match keeps everything".

~~`D16`~~ **FIXED** Draft attachment content type + HTML alternative — same file. `<airsyncbase:ContentType>` is now honoured, falling back to `MimeTypes.GetMimeType(displayName)` and only then to octet-stream; an unparsable declared type falls back rather than throwing. The body merge extracts the stored body via `ExtractBodyEntity`, which descends only into `multipart/mixed` and keeps `alternative`/`related` whole — so a flag-only Change no longer downgrades a rich draft to its text/plain sibling, and inline `cid:` parts (which MimeKit does not report as attachments, so nothing else carries them) survive. **Caveat on the [LIVE] run:** the integration suite passed unchanged at 127/127, but it exercises no draft-attachment content type or alternative-body round trip — it is a no-regression signal, not proof. The proof is the four unit reproducers, each confirmed failing against the unmodified builder before the fix.

`D8`–`D24` **Med**: `PathSeparator` documented, schema'd, test-asserted and never read (`D8`); SMTP `QUIT` cancellable after a successful send → duplicate mail (`D9`); no Sieve socket/operation timeouts (`D10`); SASL PLAIN sent without checking advertised mechanisms (`D11`); events always anchored to UTC → DST drift on recurrences (`D12`); `SetPartStat`/`ExtractUid` pick the first VEVENT not the master (`D13`); special-folder lookup re-lists the mailbox per delete (`D14`); unnamed-attachment delete removes all unnamed attachments (~~`D15`~~); draft attachments lose content type, HTML alternative dropped (~~`D16`~~); ~~`D17`~~ **FIXED** `EmptyFolderAsync` uses stale racy indexes — NOOP + SEARCH ALL + UID-scoped store/expunge. Note: the added EmptyFolderContents test is baseline coverage, not a reproducer; the stale-count symptom does not bite on Stalwart and the renumbering race has no deterministic test; local meeting response skips the base class's concurrency retry (`D18`); GAL/free-busy load and decrypt the entire collection, parsing each vCard 3× (`D19`); conversation threading splits the root from its replies; MD5 breaks on FIPS (`D20`); `HtmlToText` leaks `<style>`/`<script>` bodies into plain text (`D21`); ~~`D22`~~ **FIXED** `ToApplicationData` now returns `List<XElement>?` null for an empty/unparsable card instead of throwing, so a corrupt vCard costs one skipped contact rather than the whole Sync response; ~~`D23`~~ **FIXED** vCard folding counted chars, not octets, and could split a surrogate pair — `AppendFolded` now folds on UTF-8 byte count via `TakeUtf8`, which advances by whole code points only. The continuation space counts toward its line's 75; `EasDateTime.Parse` unguarded on client input in a dozen places (`D24`).
`D25`–`D35` + nits: readiness probe has no connect timeout (`D25`); malformed watcher key throws (`D26`); watcher rebuild race orphans a watcher (`D27`); `DisposeAsync` can hang and throw at waiters (`D28`); literal-length guard after the slice (`D29`); reader rebound across STARTTLS without draining (`D30`); Sent copy re-serialized (`D31`); `GetItemRevisionsAsync` uncapped (`D32`); free/busy terminates early on a floating occurrence (`D33`); `ConversationIndex` header is 5 bytes where the spec says 22 (`D34`); unchecked `TryWriteBytes`, char-based name truncation (`D35`). Plus: third namespace in one assembly, `MailboxAddress(from, from)`, `Limit` surrogate split, repeated ICS scans, status-line misparse, double `ToString()` per loop, `Occurrences`/`Until` exclusivity, odd untyped-phone mapping, silent >96 KiB photo drop, no `smtp.MaxSize` pre-flight.
**Verified correct (do not "fix"):** MailKit thread-safety (client never shared, serialized behind a gate, watchers own theirs); UID-vs-sequence discipline everywhere except `D17`; TLS validation (`CreateCallback` returns null when unconfigured so platform validation stays intact, and a custom root cannot repair a name mismatch); Sieve script generation is not injectable via the body (`DotStuff` correctly doubles leading dots); folder-access transitions.

## Area E — Server: pipeline, hosting, startup (35)
`E1` **High** Request bodies dropped on HTTP/2 — the body test relies on HTTP/1.1 framing (`Transfer-Encoding` is forbidden in h2, streamed bodies have no `Content-Length`) while Kestrel's HTTPS listener defaults to `Http1AndHttp2` — `Eas/EasContext.cs:51`. Delete the early return; rely on the existing zero-length check.
~~`E2`~~ **FIXED** Unauthenticated clients control Prometheus label values — `Eas/EasEndpoint.cs`, `Setup/WebApplicationExtensions.cs`. Both label values are now closed off. **Command:** clamped inside `GatewayMetrics.RecordEasRequest` via the new `EasRequestParameters.CanonicalCommand` — anything outside the MS-ASHTTP set becomes `other`, and known commands fold to one canonical casing (`sync`/`SYNC`/`Sync` were three time series). **User:** the endpoint stashes `MetricsKey` with the anonymous `"-"` user *before* auth and overwrites it with the real username only after `AuthenticateAsync` succeeds. **Deviation from the recommended fix, deliberate:** moving the whole assignment below auth would stop counting 401/429 outcomes entirely, which is exactly the traffic an operator watches during a brute-force attempt — the two-step assignment keeps the count and loses only the (attacker-chosen) name. The command clamp has a red-first reproducer (`GatewayMetricsTests`); the ordering change does **not** — there is no unit-level EAS host, and `Integration.Tests/Scenarios/MetricsTests.cs` is where it would be observable end-to-end (item 7 is not [LIVE]).
`E3` **High** Auth throttle keys on `RemoteIpAddress`; no forwarded-headers middleware, so behind an ingress every request shares one key and `MaxFailures*5` fumbles 429 the entire gateway — `Eas/EndpointAuth.cs:16`.
`E4` **Med** Every EAS request constructs all 20 handlers and their dependency graphs — `Eas/EasEndpoint.cs:53,162`. Use keyed services.
`E5` **Med** Policy document rebuilt, serialized and SHA-256'd per request — `Eas/EasEndpoint.cs:201`, `Eas/PolicyDocument.cs:46`. Cache keyed on options reference identity.
`E6` **Med** `IOptionsSnapshot<ActiveSyncOptions>` re-binds the whole options tree (including every declared user) per request — `Eas/EasEndpoint.cs:55`, `Eas/AutodiscoverEndpoint.cs:45`, `Handlers/PingHandler.cs:15`. Switch to `IOptionsMonitor`.
`E7` **Med** A watcher completing non-positively is dropped for the rest of the heartbeat; with `WatchdogSeconds=0` this becomes a tight re-poll loop — `Eas/LongPollWatchdog.cs:41`.
`E8` **Med** Long-poll drain is unbounded and one faulting watcher aborts the whole Ping into a 500 — `Eas/LongPollWatchdog.cs:45,58`.
`E9` **Med** DB log drain can die silently and take DB logging with it for the process lifetime — `Setup/DatabaseLogSink.cs:57,99`.
`E10` **Med** Log events fully rendered even when `Log:Database=false` — the switch is only checked in the drain — `Setup/DatabaseLogSink.cs:34,83`.
`E11` **Med** Settings refresh loop breaks permanently on any non-shutdown `OperationCanceledException` (e.g. an EF command timeout), freezing live settings with no log — `Setup/SettingsRefreshService.cs:16`. Also ignores `Auth:UsersRefreshSeconds` despite its own doc.
`E12` **Med** `KeepAliveTimeout = 65 min` doesn't affect long-poll duration (it's a between-requests timer); it just keeps dead phone sockets for an hour — `ProgramServer.cs:99`.
`E13` **Med** SQLite pragmas run sync-over-async on a thread-pool thread per connection open, and re-apply `journal_mode=WAL` every time — `Setup/SqlitePragmaInterceptor.cs:21`.
`E14` **Med** Autodiscover checks `IsLoginBlockedAsync` but not `IsLoginDisabled`, unlike EAS — a disabled user still gets a service document — `Eas/AutodiscoverEndpoint.cs:78`.
`E15` **Med** Startup banner logs every declared user (PII, into the DB sink) and prints arbitrary per-user backend settings in full — only `Password` is masked — `StartupSummary.cs:64,188`.
`E16` **Med** `/readyz` discloses backend topology anonymously on the phone-facing listener, and serializes all callers behind one semaphore — `ProgramServer.cs:247`, `Setup/ReadinessProbe.cs:28,33`.
`E17`–`E26` **Low**: `_requestRead` set before the read poisons the cache on failure (`E17`); `IOptionsMonitor` resolved from `RequestServices` per request (`E18`); missing users file fails with a raw framework exception (`E19`); `serverCertificate` published to the Kestrel selector without a barrier (`E20`); Basic-auth header decoded with no length bound (~~`E21`~~ **FIXED** — `Eas/HttpBasicAuth.cs`, `MaxCredentialChars = 2048` checked *before* `Convert.FromBase64String`, so a rejected request no longer costs two header-sized allocations. Kestrel's 32 KB header limit already capped the absolute damage; this is the difference between 32 KB and 1.5 KB per unauthenticated attempt, and it now also holds if that limit is ever raised. Red-first via `HttpBasicAuthTests.OversizedHeader_IsRejectedBeforeDecoding`; the file is new, so the four ordinary parse cases came with it as regression cover); migration bootstrap ignores cancellation and races across replicas (`E22`); SQLite connection strings never redacted despite accepting `Password=` (`E23`); `MeetingInvitationService` recomputes the recipient list per attendee — O(n²) (`E24`); folder-listing fallback re-queries the registry per failing store (`E25`); no exception-handling middleware, and the dev exception page auto-enables in Development — full stack traces to unauthenticated callers if `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` is left set (`E26`).
`E27`–`E35` **Nit**: `RunServerAsync` is 245 lines doing a dozen jobs (`E27`); the auth prologue is duplicated between the two authenticated endpoints — the direct cause of `E14` (`E28`); loggers created per request instead of injected (`E29`); `MeetingInvitationService` registered inside `AddEasHandlers` (`E30`); `LogText.Clean` uses LINQ over a string on the hot path (`E31`); two undisposed `SerilogLoggerFactory` instances (`E32`); `GatewayMetrics.PerUserLabels` is a set-once static, silently restart-tier (`E33`); `CaptureIcsAsync` swallows with an unused `ex`, silently re-inviting everyone (`E34`); metrics port filter allocates per rejected scrape (`E35`).
**Verified good:** `ValidateScopes`+`ValidateOnBuild` in *all* environments rules out captive dependencies (I traced the singleton graph — none capture scoped); the one construct DI validation can't see (`AddTransient(sp => …BackendRolesProvider.Current)`) is also safe.

## Area F — EAS command handlers (48)
`F1` **High** `<Sync/>` with an empty `Collections` gets Status 13 instead of replaying (only a byte-empty body replays) — `Handlers/SyncHandler.cs:42`.
~~`F2`~~ **High** Server→client `Delete` commands bypass `WindowSize` entirely and don't contribute to `MoreAvailable` — `Handlers/SyncHandler.cs:314`. FIXED in `CollectionDiff.Compute`: deletes/changes/adds now share one budget, charged in that order; an unsent tombstone keeps its snapshot entry so it reappears next round, and any truncation sets `MoreAvailable`. Same change closes `A21`. Note the restructure also removed the two unreachable branches `A20` describes — `A20` itself (the `Drain` extraction) is untouched and still belongs to item 46.
~~`F3`~~ **High** Items aging out of the sliding `FilterType` window are hard-`Delete`d, never `SoftDelete`d (`SoftDelete` is in the code page and emitted by no handler) — `Handlers/SyncHandler.cs:314`. FIXED: `ProcessCollectionAsync` classifies each windowed delete by asking the store once for the *unfiltered* revision map — present ⇒ `SoftDelete`, absent ⇒ `Delete`. **Cost:** one extra `GetItemRevisionsAsync` per round, guarded on `filter.SinceUtc is not null && diff.Deletes.Count > 0`, so unfiltered classes (contacts/tasks/notes) and `FilterType 0` pay nothing; on a filtered mail collection this is an unbounded enumeration and therefore compounds `D32` (no result cap) — capping there also caps this. If the extra listing throws we fall back to a hard `Delete` and log a warning: stranding a genuinely deleted item on the device forever is the worse failure. Metrics gained a `soft_delete` operation label alongside `delete`.
`F10` **High** Draft submit sends before recording the replay marker, and a post-send failure reports failure → user resends, recipient gets it twice — `Handlers/SyncHandler.cs:434,496,622`.
`F23` **High** Provision phase 2 never compares the presented `PolicyKey` and never reads the client's ack `Status` — the whole policy handshake is bypassable in one request — `Handlers/ProvisionHandler.cs:59`.
`F29` **High** Unresolvable source silently sends a reply with no quote / a forward with nothing forwarded — `Handlers/ComposeMailHandlers.cs:260,333`.
`F30` **High** Failures after successful submission reported as send failures → duplicates — `Handlers/ComposeMailHandlers.cs:56`.
`F4`–`F8` **Med**: Status 3 echoes the rejected sync key back, causing the resync loop (`F4`); out-of-range `Wait`/`HeartbeatInterval` silently clamped upward instead of Status 14 + `Limit`, unlike Ping (`F5`); `MIMESupport` read nowhere, Type-4 BodyPreference force-downgraded to HTML → S/MIME unusable (`F6`); client `Change` blindly overwrites, no conflict detection, `Conflict` option and Status 7 unimplemented (`F7`); `Class` never echoed despite advertising 12.1 (`F8`).
`F13`–`F21` **Med**: N+1 backend round trips plus a DB query per deleted item (`F13`); metrics count items never sent (`F14`); two device-row writes per Sync (`F15`); a detected change mapping to no collection silently loses the notification (`F16`); Ping with folders but no heartbeat returns Status 3 instead of reusing the cache (`F17`); no `MaxFolders`/Status 6 cap (`F18`); GetItemEstimate returns status 4 where the spec says 3 (`F19`); GetItemEstimate has no error handling — one flaky store 500s the whole request (`F20`); **per-folder read-only grants unenforced — `IsReadOnlyFolder` is honored in exactly 1 of ~8 mutating handlers** (`F21`).
`F25`–`F28` **Med**: FolderSync has no replay generation, so any lost response costs a full hierarchy resync (`F25`); every folder-op backend failure collapses to Status 3 ("system folder"), and non-`BackendException` escapes to a 500 (`F26`); `FolderCreate` ignores the requested `Type` and always creates a mail folder (`F27`); `FolderCreate` enumerates every store twice (`F28`).
`F32`–`F33`, `F36`, `F40`, `F43`, `F47` **Med**: no iCalendar unfolding → truncated UIDs and misdirected iTIP replies (`F32`); only the default calendar considered, and a calendar CollectionId is fed to the mail store (`F33`); `Total` reports page size so search stops after page 1 (`F36`); one sequential backend fetch per search hit (`F40`); sequential GAL + free/busy per recipient on the compose path (`F43`); `ReadOnly` mode does not block arming an out-of-office auto-reply — a real server-side Sieve rule (`F47`).
`F9`, `F11`, `F12`, `F22`, `F24`, `F31`, `F34`, `F35`, `F37`–`F39`, `F41`, `F42`, `F44`–`F46`, `F48` Low/Nit: `MoreAvailable` element ordering (`F9`); long-poll re-processing relies on an undocumented invariant (`F11`); replay rollback persisted before success (`F12`); MoveItems snapshot patching is a write-per-item and ignores the replay generation (`F22`); `PolicyType` unvalidated (`F24`); positional bool in `SetAnsweredAsync` (`F31`); every MeetingResponse failure reports Status 2, including transient (`F34`); the invitation mail is not removed after responding (`F35`); Find `Range` "0-0" for zero results (`F37`); Find result child ordering (`F38`); `Properties` built twice and reparented (`F39`); paging past `MaxFetch` returns nothing rather than an error (`F41`); ambiguous ResolveRecipients matches reported as Status 1, `MaxAmbiguousRecipients` ignored (`F42`); `options` shadowing in ItemOperations (`F44`); `EmptyFolderContents` conflates three causes and ignores `DeleteSubFolders` (`F45`); LongId Fetch bypasses the folder registry (`F46`); unrecognized Settings sections get no per-section status (`F48`).
**`F-decomp`** — `SyncHandler.cs` (826 lines): split into `SyncHandler.cs` (~120, `HandleAsync` only), `.Collection.cs` (~140), `.ClientCommands.cs` (~260), `.ServerCommands.cs` (~90), `.LongPoll.cs` (~75, or delete in favour of a shared `LongPollSession` used by Ping too), keeping `.Cache.cs`. Extract `SyncCollectionOptions` (today's private record + `ParseOptions` + persistence helpers) and `ClientCommandLedger` (wraps the four replay/applied dictionaries; drops `ApplyClientCommandAsync` from ten parameters to five and makes `F10`'s ordering enforceable in one place). Replace the anonymous triple `(XElement?, bool, (XElement, UserFolder, IContentStore)?)` with a named record struct — it's the most opaque construct in the file and naming it is what makes `F11`'s invariant expressible.
**Six repeated shapes wanting shared helpers:** resolve-collection-or-fail (12 sites), write-permission check (`F21`), `BodyPreference` parsing (two mutually inconsistent parsers), status-response writer (6 reimplementations), EAS time formatting (duplicates `EasDateTime`), long-poll scaffolding (`SyncHandler` vs `PingHandler` — the direct cause of `F16`).

## Area H — Backends: JMAP / DAV (31)

> **NOTE — Sequencing — read before starting any JMAP converter work.**
> **`H7` must be resolved and tested first; it gates `H4`, `H5` and `H6`.** The patch-vs-replace semantics of JMAP `update` determine the *shape* of the fix for all three, and the codebase currently contains contradictory evidence for both readings. Settle it against the Stalwart 0.16 test backend, record the answer, then proceed. Full rationale and the safe-under-both-readings fallback are in **item 5**.
>
> Related: **five of the seven High findings in this area** (`H4` `H5` `H6` `H7` `H23`) live in `JsCalendarConverter.cs` and `JsContactConverter.cs`, and they share a signature — a member is written in one shape and read in another, or a mapping is lossy in a way that round-trips *stably* after the first pass, so nothing downstream notices. A property-based round-trip suite (EAS → JSCalendar/JSContact → EAS) would have caught `H4`, `H5`, `H6` and `H23` mechanically; see item 42.

`H1` **High** DAV readiness probe hardcodes `RemoteCertificateValidationCallback => true`, overriding the operator's TLS settings; the JMAP probe does it correctly — `Dav/DavReadiness.cs:12`.
`H2` **High** Percent-decoded hrefs are re-resolved as URIs, so a resource whose name contains `#`, `?` or `%` resolves to the wrong path (verified empirically on .NET 10) — `Dav/WebDavClient.cs:306`.
`H3` **High** `If-Match` silently dropped when the ETag isn't RFC-quoted → unconditional PUT, lost update, and the `idempotent: true` justification breaks — `Dav/WebDavClient.cs:132`.
~~`H4`~~ **FIXED** `recurrenceRules` written as an array, read with the id-map helper → recurrence never survived a round trip — `Jmap/JsCalendarConverter.cs`. **Worse than the review recorded, and the live run is what showed it:** Stalwart 0.16 does not implement RFC 8984 §4.3.2's plural `recurrenceRules` array at all — it emits and accepts the JSCalendar-*draft* `recurrenceRule`, a single bare object, and answers the plural name with `invalidProperties` in **every** form tried (minimal `{frequency}`, with/without `@type`, with `count`, with `byDay`, and `null`/`[]`). So creating or updating a recurring event through JMAP did not merely lose the rule, it **failed the whole request**.
> Reading now accepts both spellings (`RecurrenceOf`); writing mirrors the shape the stored event demonstrates and otherwise defaults to the singular one, which is what the only verifiable backend accepts. A strictly RFC 8984 server is therefore served correctly on **update** (its own plural member is mirrored) but would get the singular member on **create** — a one-line change in `RecurrenceRuleMember` if such a backend ever appears, and worth revisiting when a second JMAP-calendar server is available to test against.
> Both spellings are covered by a `[Theory]` unit reproducer plus `Event_Recurrence_RoundTripsThroughTheServer`; all were confirmed red first (the live one failing as `invalidProperties`, not as a lost rule).
~~`H5`~~ **FIXED** Recurrence day-ordinals dropped both directions; `byMonthDay`/`byMonth`/`bySetPosition` unmapped — `Jmap/JsCalendarConverter.cs`. `NDay.nthOfPeriod` now maps to and from `WeekDay.Offset`, and the three by-parts are carried in both directions (`byMonth` is a *string* array in JSCalendar; a non-Gregorian leap-month value such as `"5L"` has no iCalendar equivalent and is skipped rather than mis-parsed).
> **The trap here is that `WeekDay.Offset` is `int?`, so the obvious `w.Offset != 0` guard is true for null** and emitted `"nthOfPeriod": null`, which then threw out of `TryGetInt32` on the way back in. Both sides are ValueKind/null-guarded.
> Red-first proof is a five-case `[Theory]`, four of which failed with exactly the described degradations — "2nd Tuesday" → 1st, "the 15th" → the event's own start day (20th), "March" → the event's own start month (July) — plus the live `Event_RecurrenceDayOrdinal_RoundTripsThroughTheServer`. The fifth case (the weekday itself) passed before the fix and is kept as coverage.
~~`H6`~~ **FIXED** Birthday written to `date.utc`, read from `date.date` — `Jmap/JsContactConverter.cs`. `date.date` is not an RFC 9553 shape at all: `Anniversary.date` is either a `Timestamp` (`utc`) or a `PartialDate` (year/month/day numbers). `AnniversaryDate` now reads both — plus a bare `date`/`local` string, which costs one line and some servers have shipped.
> **The write stays a `Timestamp`, deliberately.** A `PartialDate` is arguably the more faithful shape for a birthday, but the EAS `Birthday` element *is* a full UTC timestamp, so Timestamp keeps the two models symmetric and invents no precision; Stalwart 0.16 accepts and returns it (verified by `Contact_Birthday_RoundTripsThroughTheServer`). PartialDate reading requires all three of year/month/day — a partial one cannot become an EAS Birthday and is dropped rather than guessed at. `"@type": "Anniversary"` is now emitted as well.
~~`H7`~~ **FIXED** Update patches omit cleared fields — `Jmap/JsContactConverter.cs`, `JsCalendarConverter.cs`. **Settled empirically against Stalwart 0.16: `*/set update` is a PatchObject** (RFC 8620 §5.3 reading). Proof is the red-first reproducer `Update_OmittingAManagedField_ClearsItOnTheServer` — omitting `titles` from a `ContactCard/set update` left the old job title in place. Both converters now emit an explicit `null` for every managed member the payload did not populate, but **only on update** (`existing is not null`); a create sends only what it has, since a null there is a member the card/event never had. This is also correct under full-replace semantics, so the fix is safe under both readings.
> Two deliberate exclusions. `media` (contacts): the EAS Contacts view neither reads nor writes the photo, so nulling it every edit would destroy a picture the client never saw. The **recurrence** member (calendar): its name and shape are server-dependent — Stalwart answers `"recurrenceRules": …` with `invalidProperties` in *every* form tried, including the minimal RFC 8984 one, so clearing it is handled in `H4` alongside the shape it is actually read in.
> **What the calendar test does and does not prove.** Most calendar fields cannot show this at the store layer at all: `CalendarConverter.FromApplicationData` merges the payload onto the *stored iCalendar*, so an absent `<Location>` is restored before the JSCalendar bridge ever sees it — a first attempt using Location was green with and without the fix. The reproducer therefore uses free→busy, the one case that reaches the bridge as a cleared member (`BusyStatus` 2 ⇒ `TRANSP:OPAQUE` ⇒ `freeBusyStatus` omitted). Consequence worth knowing: for JMAP calendars, "clear this field" is bounded by that iCalendar merge, not by this fix.
`H8` **High** Hardcoded page size of 500 ignores `maxObjectsInGet` (→ `requestTooLarge` fails the whole folder sync), and a server-capped `limit` breaks the loop after page 1 → silently truncated folder — `Jmap/JmapMailStore.cs:126`.
`H9`–`H25` **Med**: session capabilities parsed as a bare key set, so limits and `HasCapability` are unusable (`H9`); `JmapResponse` leaked at five call sites, four of which therefore never check per-item `*/set` failure buckets (`H10`); `DavPollSeconds` documented, configured, consumed only by JMAP — DAV hardcodes 60s (`H11`); ctag poll costs 1–2 PROPFINDs per folder per cycle and a transient error reads as "changed", causing a full re-sync (`H12`); creating one item costs one or two full collection enumerations (`H13`); GAL over CardDAV is a sequential GET per contact (`H14`); Ping/Sync waits re-download and hash every event/card per poll tick (`H15`); no `/changes` or `sync-collection` anywhere — permanently full-enumeration (`H16`); EventSource stream killed every 100s by `HttpClient.Timeout`, plus a response leak on the error path (`H17`); retried create-PUT turns a succeeded create into a spurious 412 failure (`H18`); mail folder token is `total:unread`, so flag changes and equal add/delete are invisible to Ping (`H19`); JMAP stores never throw `BackendItemNotFoundException`, so `UpdateItemAsync` on a deleted message reports success (`H20`); `CalDavBackendProvider` builds the shared client with one role's settings and another role's credentials (`H21`); default contacts folder chosen from unsorted server output — `CalDavStore` already fixed this for calendars (`H22`); ~~`H23`~~ **FIXED** floating-time events silently converted to UTC — `Jmap/JsCalendarConverter.cs` (`ToICalendar`). A JSCalendar event with no `timeZone` is floating (RFC 8984 §4.1.2) and must stay floating; the `?: new CalDateTime(start, "UTC")` fallback moved a 09:00 standup to 11:00 for a Copenhagen viewer. A null `tzId` is exactly what Ical.Net wants for a floating value, so the zone is now passed straight through and the branch disappears. The write side already omitted `timeZone` for a floating start, so no change was needed there. **Reproducer is the unit test `FloatingEvent_StaysFloating_AndIsNotAnchoredToUtc`, confirmed red first, with `ZonedEvent_KeepsItsZone` as the control that must not change; the live suite is a no-regression signal only** — Stalwart normalises the zone it echoes (it answers `"UTC"` with `"Etc/UTC"`), so a floating event is not observable through it end-to-end; multi-status responses fully buffered as strings with no size cap (`H24`); per-item update costs 3 round trips, delete costs a full mailbox listing (`H25`).
`H26`–`H31` Low/Nit: probes construct and discard an `HttpClient` per call (`H26`); multi-status partial failures dropped without a trace, `Contains("200")` status test (`H27`); XXE hardening is correct but purely inherited from framework defaults and undocumented — make it explicit (`H28`); `ContentFilter` ignored by the JMAP calendar/contact stores, unlike CalDAV (`H29`); hand-rolled time-range format string (`H30`); dead locals (`H31`).
**Cross-cutting:** `JmapClient` and `WebDavClient` are near-twins (identical handler setup, auth header, timeout, byte-identical `IsSafeRedirect`, near-identical redirect-following send — the JMAP copy's comment even says "Mirrors WebDavClient"). That duplication is *why* `H17` exists in one and not the other and why `H1` could diverge. Extract a `BackendHttpClientFactory` into `Backends.Common`.
**Verified good:** manual same-origin redirect handling with a credential-leak rationale; the `AllRealOnly` idempotency gate correctly distinguishing replayable reads from `*/set`; response bodies deliberately excluded from exception messages; the trace logger's "method, URI and body only, NEVER headers" construction; the Axigen workarounds carry live-verification dates.

## Area K — Security / Crypto / Plugins / Observability / Contracts (70)
~~`K1`~~ **FIXED** Unauthenticated metric-label cardinality bomb (`user` + `command`) — `Observability/GatewayMetrics.cs` (see ~~`E2`~~ for the full note). The clamp lives in `GatewayMetrics` itself, not only at the call site, so any future caller inherits it.
`K6` **High** Self-signed certificate lifetime of **20 years** violates Apple's 825-day limit — iOS/macOS are the flagship clients, so a user who explicitly trusts it can still be refused — `Security/GatewayCertificateStore.cs:139`. Issue ≤398 days and add the renewal the doc says doesn't exist.
`K38` **High** `Plugins:Directory` is DB-settable → admin UI to in-process arbitrary code execution with the master key in memory; `Register` also receives the live `IServiceCollection`, so a plugin can replace any host registration — `Plugins/PluginLoader.cs:34`, `Administration/SettingKeys.cs:50`.
`K56` **High** `BackendCredentials` is a `record` → synthesized `ToString()` prints the plaintext password, recursively via `ResolvedRole`/`BackendConnectionContext`. Published plugin contract — `Contracts/Models.cs:6`.
`K7`–`K11` cert store **Med/Low**: IP-literal `PublicUrl` produces a DNS SAN instead of an IP SAN, and loopback IPs are absent (`K7`); concurrent regeneration makes replicas serve different certificates behind one LB — devices see a MITM (`K8`); unencrypted PKCS#12 private key never zeroed, `DefaultKeySet` persists a key container per load (`K9`); undecryptable row silently replaces the certificate (`K10`); `TryLoad` catch list too narrow (`K11`); magic row id (`K12`).
`K13`–`K18` TLS resolver **Med/Nit**: `DescribeAsync` imports the private key just to read public metadata — a key-container file per admin refresh (`K13`); master key loaded and never zeroed, loader error discarded (`K14`); **no validation that the operator's certificate has a private key or is unexpired** (`K15`); public-key objects never disposed — up to 3 native handles leaked per describe (`K16`); exception filter can let `ArgumentException` escape to a 500 (`K17`); doc contradicts the code (`K18`).
`K19`–`K21` content protector: **AAD delimiter is ambiguous** — `userName + "\n" + collection` is not injective, so cross-collection ciphertext substitution is possible; the repo already ships the correct primitive in `DelimitedKey` (`K19`); `Dispose` zeroes a live singleton's key with no guard, so post-dispose calls encrypt under an all-zero key (`K20`); passthrough mode silently double-wraps `v1:` values (`K21`).
`K22`–`K25` hasher: **attacker-influenced PBKDF2 iteration count has no upper bound** — a stored `pbkdf2$2000000000$…` makes every login burn minutes of CPU (`K22`); hashed-vs-plaintext verify times differ by five orders of magnitude, remotely enumerating which accounts still have plaintext passwords (`K23`); no rehash-on-verify so `DefaultIterations` can never actually be raised (`K24`); no argument validation (`K25`).
`K26`–`K32` throttle: **unbounded growth + O(n) scan per failure** under a username-rotating attack (~~`K26`~~ **FIXED** — `Security/AuthThrottle.cs`. Two changes: a hard `MaxTrackedKeys = 10_000` cap, and cleanup moved off the per-failure path onto the *new-key* path with a 30s minimum spacing. **The cap drops new keys once full rather than evicting** — the attacker's per-address counter is minted long before the table fills and keeps blocking them, so dropping is safe, whereas LRU eviction would let a rotator evict a real user's counter. Red-first proof is `FailureTable_IsBounded_UnderUsernameRotation` + `FailureTable_DoesNotRescanItself_OnEveryFailure`; the second one is also the clearest number in this document — 60k failures took **9m02s** before the fix and **2s** after, which is the O(n)-per-request cost made visible. `AtCapacity_ExistingCountersStillBite` is a guard, not a reproducer. Note `K27` (unlocked read in prune) survives the rewrite untouched and still belongs to item 53); unlocked read in prune (`K27`); lost-update race with `RecordSuccess` (`K28`); success never relieves the per-address counter, so a few stale phones behind NAT 429 everyone (`K29`); EAS keys not namespaced unlike WebUi's (`K30`); **no `AuthThrottleTests` at all** (`K31`); direct `DateTime.UtcNow` makes it untestable (`K32`).
`K33`–`K37` WireLog: `Payload` copies the entire input before truncating — a 50 MB body allocates a second 50 MB LOH string to keep 16 KB (`K33`); `Truncate` can split a surrogate pair (`K34`); CR/LF preserved, so log forging is possible on line-oriented sinks — and the sibling `LogText.Clean` makes the *opposite* choice (`K35`); `WireLog` and `LogText` duplicate the same security-relevant scrubber across two assemblies (`K36`); no redaction helper, so every caller reinvents masking (`K37`).
`K39`–`K44` plugin loader: contract-version guard bypassed by a transitive reference (`K39`); `GetTypes()` on an untrusted assembly is an uncaught crash surface, and the `IsPublic` filter promised by the error message is missing (`K40`); host-first resolution silently downgrades plugin-private dependencies for *every* assembly, not just the contract (`K41`); a relative `Plugins:Directory` resolves against the CWD while the default resolves against the app base — so setting it to its own documented default changes behaviour (`K42`); missing entry assembly warns and continues, contradicting the stated fail-fast policy (`K43`); the ALC is dependency isolation, **not** a security boundary — reword the doc and add optional hash/signature pinning (`K44`).
`K45`–`K50` crypto: **global fixed PBKDF2 salt** — one rainbow table covers every deployment (`K45`); short passphrases only warn, no floor (`K46`); key material lives in unzeroable `string`s while the derived bytes are carefully zeroed — the high-value secret is protected less carefully than the low-value one (`K47`); `IsShortPassphrase` re-reads the key file (`K48`); **namespace/assembly mismatch** (`K49`); loader error discarded by a caller (`K50`).
`K51`–`K55`: AES-GCM framing duplicated verbatim between `SecretValue` and `LocalContentProtector` (~60 lines, two assemblies) (`K51`); no key-length or null validation on the published API, unlike its in-repo sibling (`K52`); coarse error strings (`K53`); **sealed CLI envelopes are replayable within the 60s window**, and `Math.Abs` doubles it to 120s (`K54`); `TryOpen`'s "never throws" contract not fully honoured (`K55`).
`K57`–`K70` contracts: host-only types leak into the plugin surface (`K57`); `IContentStore` is a 12-member mandatory interface with no versioning affordance despite the file demonstrating the optional-capability pattern three times (`K58`); `ct` not last on `DeleteItemAsync`, plus an optional parameter on an interface method (`K59`); `BackendConnection.DisposeAsync` leaks on first throw, isn't idempotent, and never disposes the stores (`K60`); `CreateConnection` is synchronous in an otherwise fully async contract — change it now while the ecosystem is empty (`K61`); **`SharedCollection.Parse` fails open** — any unrecognized mode suffix yields read-write (`K62`); parse/validate duplication (`K63`); an unparseable `baseUrl` skips the cross-host guard, so an absolute URL to an attacker host validates (`K64`); `DelimitedKey` argument validation (`K65`); `ContentFilter` factories read the wall clock (`K66`); `BackendItemNotFoundException` doesn't derive from `BackendException`, so the codebase-wide `catch (BackendException)` idiom misses it — and `BackendException` is sealed so plugins can't add typed errors (`K67`); shared static `EmptySection` (`K68`); no `ContractVersion` constant anywhere (`K69`); `Register` hands plugins the live host `IServiceCollection` with no documentation of the trust level (`K70`).
`K2`–`K5` metrics: `ActiveLongPolls` entries never removed (`K2`); unsynchronized static observer slots (`K3`); un-namespaced instrument names, duration histogram drops `status` (`K4`); no auth-outcome counters, no cert-expiry gauge, `RecordThrottleRejection` can't distinguish EAS from WebUi (`K5`).
**Boundary verdict:** the extraction was right and holds — no EF Core, `SyncDbContext`, `ActiveSyncOptions` or Core host graph leaks into Contracts. Keep `Contracts → Protocol`, but fix the stated reason: the csproj says "EAS constants" and the only compile-time use (`ContentFilter.ForClass`) is called **only from the host** — yet plugins genuinely need Protocol because `BackendItem(IReadOnlyList<XElement>)` and `SearchGalAsync` require every provider to hand-build EAS XML in the right namespaces. Move `ForClass` to Core, correct the comment. Also resolve the contradiction that Contracts claims to be "THE one package" while `BackendConfigField` has a `Secret` type and nothing in Contracts can seal it (`K71` — add an `ISecretProtector` abstraction or document that secret-handling plugins also take `ActiveSync.Crypto`).

## Area W — WBXML codec and protocol support types (21)
`W1` **CRITICAL** No nesting-depth or element-count limit — a 64 MB body of `0x45` bytes yields ~64M nested `XElement`s, multiple GB of heap, OOM of the whole gateway from one authenticated device — `Wbxml/WbxmlDecoder.cs:55`. Add `MaxDepth = 256` / `MaxElements = 200_000`.
`W2` **High** `WbxmlEncoder.WriteElement` is unbounded-recursive → uncatchable `StackOverflowException`, instant process death — `Wbxml/WbxmlEncoder.cs:40`.
`W3` **Med** `ReadMultiByteUInt` accumulates 35 bits into a `uint` and silently overflows — `Wbxml/WbxmlDecoder.cs:197`.
`W4` **Med** `DecodeAsync` copies an unbounded stream and truncates length to `int` — `Wbxml/WbxmlDecoder.cs:28`.
`W5` **Med** OPAQUE data base64'd into a `string` — three full copies of every attachment, all LOH — `Wbxml/WbxmlDecoder.cs:76`, `WbxmlEncoder.cs:69`.
> **Partially fixed.** The encoder's intermediate `byte[]` is gone — `WriteOpaque` decodes base64 into an `ArrayPool` buffer, removing one LOH allocation per attachment per request. **Two copies remain and are not fixable here**, because both are inherent to representing opaque data as base64 text on an `XText`: the decoder's `Convert.ToBase64String` (1.33× the payload), and `Encode`'s closing `ToArray()` over the whole response. Removing them means changing the representation so opaque payloads travel as `byte[]` out-of-band — a change across every producer and consumer of the marker attribute, not a WBXML-layer edit. The accompanying test is **coverage for the pooled path, not a reproducer**: an allocation count is not observable from a round trip, so nothing here fails against the old code.
`W6` **Med** Malformed base64 escapes as `FormatException` rather than `WbxmlException`, mid-response-write — `Wbxml/WbxmlEncoder.cs:69`.
`W7` **Med** Encoder silently drops text when an element has both text and children (and drops children when opaque) — `Wbxml/WbxmlEncoder.cs:67`.
> Fixed by walking `element.Nodes()` in document order instead of the text-or-children branch. Two deliberate choices: opaque-with-children is now a **`WbxmlException`** rather than a silent drop (an element cannot be both a payload and a container, and guessing which half to keep is worse than refusing); and **whitespace-only text nodes are still skipped when the element has child elements**, so indentation from a parsed document does not start leaking into values — the old branch discarded it, and node-order walking would otherwise emit it.
`W8` **Med** Encoder writes NUL characters into NUL-terminated inline strings, scrambling the document — `Wbxml/WbxmlEncoder.cs:81`.
> Fixed by **stripping** NUL in `WriteInlineString`, not by throwing. NUL is not legal in XML content either, and the value reaching the encoder is backend-supplied (a subject line, a display name) — throwing would fail an entire sync response over one bad byte in one field, which is a worse outcome than dropping the byte.
`W9`–`W11` Nit/Low: dead read before an unconditional throw (`W9`); undisposed `MemoryStream` (`W10`); charset `0x03` accepted but decoded as UTF-8 (`W11`).
`W12`–`W14` Code pages: verified token-by-token against MS-ASWBXML for pages 0,1,2,4,5,7,8,9,12,14,15,16,17,18,20,25 — all deliberate gaps correct. Missing Tasks `0x21 CompressedRTF`; empty `AirNotify` page gives a confusing error (`W12`); a duplicate tag name anywhere fails as `TypeInitializationException` on the **first WBXML request the gateway ever serves** — add a table-validation test (`W13`); tables are hand-maintained tuples with version applicability only in comments (`W14`).
`W15` **High** `EasDateTime.ToLong/ToCompact` shift `DateTimeKind.Unspecified` values by the server's UTC offset — silent timezone-dependent corruption that looks fine in UTC CI — `EasDateTime.cs:9`.
`W16` **Med** `EasDateTime.Parse` throws `FormatException` on client-supplied garbage and falls back to a culture-sensitive loose parse — `EasDateTime.cs:20`.
`W17` **Med** Base64 query version byte unvalidated — a byte of 255 yields "25.5", satisfying every `>= V160`/`V161` gate, so a client unlocks 16.x behaviour it never negotiated. The command code immediately below *is* range-checked — `Http/EasRequestParameters.cs:103`.
`W18` **Med** `ToBase64` truncates length prefixes >255 bytes (`LongId`, `AttachmentName` are realistically long) — `Http/EasRequestParameters.cs:191,205`.
`W19`–`W21` Low/Nit: raw `FormatException`/overflow on a malformed `ProtocolVersion` (`W19`); `EasVersion.Parse` uses the **current culture** for integer parsing while the rest of the layer is careful to use invariant (`W20`); `EasFolderType` missing 18/19, `EasClass` missing `SMS` (`W21`).

## Area L — CLI (27)
`L22` **High** With no encryption key configured, `/cli` falls back to loopback-only auth — so a production misconfiguration silently degrades to the model the design explicitly rejects, and any co-located sidecar or local process gets `eas user set`, `eas device password`, `eas purge user --yes` — `Cli/LocalCliEndpoint.cs:75`. Gate on an explicit `AllowPlaintext` + startup warning, not on key absence.
`L23` **Med** Requests are sealed; responses (including `eas device password` output) travel loopback in plaintext — `Cli/LocalCliEndpoint.cs:60`.
`L24` **Med** No audit trail for any `/cli` command — account deletion, device-password disclosure, password changes leave no record — `Cli/LocalCliEndpoint.cs:50`.
`L25` **Med** Process-global `Console.SetOut/SetError` inside a live web server: for the duration of every forwarded command, all gateway log output for all concurrent requests is captured into that command's stdout and vanishes from the container log — `Cli/LocalCliEndpoint.cs:128`.
`L26`–`L27` Low: `CapturingRegistrar.Resolve` has no cycle detection → `StackOverflowException` in the gateway process (`L26`); envelope replay bounded by time but not by nonce, so a captured envelope re-executes destructive verbs for 60s (`L27`).
`L28` **Med** `eas tls` passes X.500 DNs and file paths through Spectre's **markup** parser — a `[` in a certificate subject crashes the command. This is the one file that reaches for the raw `params string[]` overload; every other command file correctly wraps cells in `Text`/`Markup.Escape` — `Cli/TlsCommand.cs:42`.
`L29` **Med** `eas config set` echoes secret values in plaintext, though `config list`/`get` mask them — `Cli/ConfigCommands.cs:198`.
`L30` **Med** `eas config list` prints non-`Password` backend secrets (`ApiKey`, `Token`, `ClientSecret`) in the clear — `Cli/ConfigCommands.cs:107`, `SettingKeys.cs:196`.
`L31` **Med** `eas users` builds rows case-insensitively but joins state case-sensitively → a mixed-case login reports 0 devices, 0 folders and **"not blocked" when it is** — `Cli/InspectCommands.cs:89,131`; same mismatch in `DeviceCommands`, `FoldersCommand`, `ItemsCommand`, `BlockCommands`.
`L32` **Med** `eas purge user` claims to delete ALL state but leaves `SharedCalendarGrants` behind — recreating the login resurrects read-write grants to someone else's calendar — `Cli/PurgeCommands.cs:70`.
`L33` **Med** Errors bypass the injected console entirely (raw `Console.Error`), so **no CLI test can assert on any error message or exit code** — and it's the reason `L25`'s process-global redirection exists.
`L34` **Low** `device wipe` and `block` are destructive with no confirmation, while `purge` has a well-built confirm flow — `Cli/DeviceCommands.cs:109`, `BlockCommands.cs:39`.
`L35` **Med** Every CLI command rebuilds a full DI container, EF model and plugin set — including when forwarded to the warm gateway that already has all three — `Cli/CliServices.cs:17`. This is what makes `Cli/` feel like a foreign body in Server; fix it and the assembly question dissolves.
`L36` **Med** The slim client re-runs the command locally after a server-side 5xx or timeout — when it is very likely still running — `ActiveSync.Cli/Program.cs:52`. Only fall back on 404 and connection failure.
`L37`–`L48` Low/Nit: `--since` overflow (`L37`); `--limit` silently rewritten (`L38`); `BuildConfiguration` throws on a missing users file — defeating the very command meant to repair configuration — and leaks a `ConfigurationRoot` (`L39`); `healthcheck` targets `localhost` and hits the exact IPv6 stall the slim client documents and avoids (`L40`); O(n²) scans in `UsersCommand` (`L41`); master key not zeroed when stdin reading fails — in the long-lived gateway process (`L42`); `isGatewayPassword` inferred from the absence of a colon (`L43`); inconsistent exit codes (0/1/-1) for "nothing to do" (`L44`); `RunLocal` hard-codes `dotnet` on PATH, so every fallback fails on a self-contained/AOT layout (`L45`); `CliRequest`/`CliResponse` declared twice with drifting defaults — a rename silently nulls `Sealed`, dropping to unauthenticated handling (`L46`); `ShowCommand` doesn't validate `<collection>` (`L47`); inconsistent `Terminal` access (`L48`).
**`L-verdict`** — do **not** split the CLI out of `ActiveSync.Server`. A clean split is blocked in three places (`ServeCommand` → `RunServerAsync`; `/cli` needs the command tree in-process for the warm-start benefit that is its whole reason to exist; `CliServices`/`CliVerbs` depend on `Server.Setup`), and extracting would mean duplicating that setup or hoisting a fourth assembly — real churn for a boundary that buys nothing. Instead: fix `L35`, and do two in-assembly cleanups — unify the three command base hierarchies (`DatabaseCommand`, `SettingsCommandBase`, and two bare `AsyncCommand`s that hand-roll the same bootstrap), and split `InspectCommands.cs` (346 lines, 5 commands) and `UserCommands.cs` (379 lines, 9 commands), whose density is actively hiding `L31` and `L41`.

## Area S — cross-cutting structural (my own pass)
`S1` **High** `Backends.Common` (packed, plugin-facing) references all of `ActiveSync.Core` for a single `WireLog.Payload` call; the seven `using ActiveSync.Core.Backend;` directives are dead. Verified: Core/Backend declares exactly 7 types, no extension methods, none referenced in Backends.Common. See item 15.
`S2` **Med** `ActiveSync.Crypto` declares `ActiveSync.Core.Security` / `ActiveSync.Core.Options` namespaces (= `K49`).
`S3` **Med** Two independent write paths to the same tables (Core services vs WebUi direct EF) (= `C18`).
`S4` **Low** `MergedFreeBusy` and `CollectionDiff` are pure protocol logic with no EF/Core-state dependency — they belong in `ActiveSync.Protocol` where they'd also be easier to fuzz.
`S5` **Med** No architecture test enforcing any of the above; the plugin boundary is currently enforced by a csproj comment.
`S6` **Low** Nothing enforces the Sqlite/Npgsql migration sets stay in lockstep (1:1 across all 15 today). Add a CI check on the ordered migration-name lists.
`S7` **Med** Four independent secret-redaction implementations: `ConfigCommands.Mask`, `StartupSummary.Redact`, `BackendsEndpoints.SecretMask`, `MailKitWireLogger.Redact` — each with a different notion of what to hide. See item 13.
`S8` **Nit** `Backends.Common` spans three namespaces across 19 files (`ActiveSync.Backends`, `.Common`, `.Converters`); `ServerCertificateValidator.cs:5` is the odd one out.
`S9` **Nit** Ten+ copies of the same three-line `#pragma warning disable VSTHRD103` + identical explanatory comment (`SyncStateService` alone has five). Hoist to one file-level suppression with the comment once, or an `.editorconfig` entry with the rationale.

## Found while working the queue

*Not part of any item's scope when they were spotted. Unnumbered by area on purpose — assign an ID and an item when one is picked up.*

`H32` **Med** `EnsureNotIn` in `JmapCalendarStore` and `JmapContactStore` reports only the JMAP `SetError.type`, discarding `description` and — for `invalidProperties`, the single most common `*/set` failure — the `properties` array naming exactly which members the server rejected. Diagnosing `H4` required patching the raw error text in by hand; without it the message is "invalidProperties." and nothing else, for a request carrying a dozen members. Include the rejected property names. Related to `H10` but distinct: this is the message, not the checking. — `Jmap/JmapCalendarStore.cs`, `JmapContactStore.cs` (`EnsureNotIn`).

`D36` **Med** `CalendarConverter.FromApplicationData` merges the EAS payload onto the *stored* iCalendar, so for calendar items **an absent element means "keep", never "clear"** — there is no way for a client to remove a Location, a Body or an attendee list. This is the opposite of the presence-decides rule `D4` established for contacts, it is undocumented, and it silently bounded `H7`: the JMAP null-out fix cannot express a clear for any field this merge restores first (found when a Location-based `H7` reproducer went green with and without the fix). Affects CalDAV and JMAP alike since both go through this converter. Decide the rule once, as `D4` did, and write it down. — `Backends.Common/Converters/CalendarConverter.cs:193`.
